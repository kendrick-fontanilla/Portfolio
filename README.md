I understand that this is not as a valid reason/excuse, but I would like to at least try to explain my situation, even if the chances of this submission disregarded  high.

I completely understand if points are deducted from my activity due to it not being edited or if this activity isnt graded. If the decision results in an immediate score of zero, I will respect that outcome without any objections. My intention is not to make excuses but to explain the circumstances that led to this situation.


Here is my reasoning for submitting this activity with recently edited repositories. Last week, while working on this activity, I had a hard time  with creating a repository. After spending an entire day troubleshooting, I discovered that a '.git' file inside my C drive was trying to access every file within that drive. And after  I resolved the issue, I pushed the initial version of the activity , however, I forgot to push the updates after completing the final version. As a result, I am now manually editing and submitting the code I wrote last week.


Sincerely Kendrick Fontanilla
